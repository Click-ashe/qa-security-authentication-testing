# Authentication Testing & Security Review

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic Quality Assurance (QA) testing and introductory cybersecurity review of a web application's authentication (login) functionality.

The goal of this project is to show how functional testing and security awareness work together to identify issues that could impact users and system security.

## Scope of Testing
- Login functionality
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Basic authentication security risks

## Tools Used
- Web browser (Chrome / Firefox)
- GitHub
- Markdown documentation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Manual QA testing
- Writing test cases
- Bug reporting
- Security risk identification
- Technical documentation

## Why This Project Matters
Authentication is one of the most common attack surfaces in real-world applications. Testing login functionality helps uncover both functional bugs and security weaknesses early in the development lifecycle.

## Status
Project in progress.
